The moment the weather warms up, people in Tokyo head to Kamakura. I’m a person in Tokyo, so you know, when in Rome…

Kamakura is a few train rides away from central Tokyo and is as close to California as Japan gets: organic diners, surfers, architect-designed homes, salty air, and an abundance of tan people who probably inherited their wealth. Interspersed throughout homes that were built in the last few years, though, are grand homes and estates that were built 50-100 years ago. Kamakura is 100% “rustic” beach town. Malibu it is not.

The moment you hit the beach, however, you make a pretty startling discovery about Japanese beaches: they’re gross and poorly cared for. It’s not that there’s trash everywhere, it’s that there’s stuff from the sea everywhere, which might as well just be trash. Chunks of wood and ocean debris that’s washed ashore, boats owned by local fishermen that may or may not have been used in the last 10 years judging by the rust, large rocks that seem to have no place being there, and other miscellaneous waste. The beaches in Kamakura, one of the more expensive places to live outside of Tokyo, are pretty baffling to see. Sometimes the locals go through and clean them, but it’s impossible to get 100%. Still, it’s better to retreat to a dirty beach than staying in the concrete jungle.

In Saitama, the prefecture north of Tokyo, there’s an incredible train museum that displays historical trains from standard passenger trains to the train that the emperor used to ride around in.

Even if you don’t like trains, you can point at the Japanese history of trains—from old railroads through to the most modern shinkansen—and realize how incredible humans are as a species. It’s a testament to what humans can accomplish when all horses are pulling in the same direction.

You could go on endlessly about why the train system in Japan works the way it does. For me, it boils down to one reason: a mutual respect between the people operating the service and the people using the service. Neither side wants to disappoint each other, so they do everything they can to keep things running smoothly. The ease with which you can move around in this country is one of the best things about living here.
