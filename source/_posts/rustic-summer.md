There’s this kind of infamous plot of land overlooking the Pacific Ocean east of Sendai. A year or so ago when we first came here, my wife told me about this group of houses that sat on land that only foreigners could purchase.

Huh?

I thought this was strange, so I did my research and found that you could actually rent certain units via a kind of secret Google Form. I submitted the form, received a response, and booked a stay.

It it was indeed a large plot of land overlooking the ocean. I learned that most of the land was owned by churches in the west. When missionaries came over from the US, they often stayed at these homes. Other homes in the area were vacation houses for foreigners living and working in Tokyo, while some homes where lived in full time by mostly English-speaking foreigners. Our image of the cabin was a bit different from the reality. We didn’t end up staying too long.

The beaches of east Sendai along the ocean can be quite lovely. They say that this offers some of the best surfing in the country but I’m not sure if “they” have been to Sydney or Santa Monica.

Between the bugs and the dirty floors and the state of the shower and the cobwebs and the lack of AC, we bailed early. We’ve had a lot of good travel experience here in Japan but this one was not one of them. The sunset that evening was a nice bookend.
