To the great white north (Hokkaido, not Canada).

May was a huge month, mostly because of its proximity to April. April, admittedly, was a lot of everything: preparation, waiting, anxiety, time, money, frustration, and risk. Consequently, the impact of April spilled over into May. Yes, we returned to Japan in late April with a new appreciation for our home, but I think we underestimated the lingering effects of international travel in the pandemic.

Not satisfied with the gauntlet of travel we just went through the previous month, we started off May with two trips: a business trip back to Tokyo and a trip to Hokkaido to visit a friend's new baby.

First up, back to Tokyo.

Business trips have lost a lot of their luster to me, even at 200mph. I think it's two things: the lingering fear that I won't remember to save my receipts and the dread of having to expense them later.

Will my life be substantially different if I fail to be reimbursed for the $3.50 coffee from Starbucks? No, and yet I will worry excessively about it the whole trip, as if one day I will go to put a down payment on a house and be $3.50 short.

The anxiety of saving receipts is exceeded only by the pain of expensing them. I know the folks at Concur are doing their best, but expensing receipts is one of those activities for me where I'm painfully aware that someday I will die and that I don't have a lot of time left. As I am uploading the image of the receipt, fighting the software's image recognition to get it to recognize the date on the receipt, and filling in a description so the company knows what on earth I was doing at Starbucks, I can't help but think, is this a good use of my time here? Why do human beings do this to ourselves?

I stared out the Shinkansen window for a long time. I was moved by how close everything was. Were I a better writer, I could muse on how life in Japan is a balance of distance and closeness. I'll just dip my toe into the water, I guess.

Coming back from the US last month, you're instantly made aware of how close things are here. Obviously, the houses and apartments here are close together (even in the countryside), and the population in the cities means you're never too far from another person. More than that, though, things like bullet trains and the Japanese shipping infrastructure make distances feel close together (specifically, how fast you can get a parcel from one corner of the country to the other). It's a wonder anyone pays for 2-day Prime shipping here. Most items arrive next day or the day after if they're sent from the main island. To an American, it doesn't always feel natural given the space we have overseas, and so returning home to Japan can mess your head a bit, as if you're on the brink of claustrophobia.

Below, you can see some small houses that people live in right next to the Shinkansen track, all while moving 200mph in near-complete silence. That's close. These homes are small, dorm-style houses that families live in where the dad works at one of the local factories. Often times these families come from China or Vietnam to seek a better life here, and the families will be apart for years awaiting entry visas. Still, they stick it out. We should all be so lucky to have that kind of closeness.

A final thought overtook my train of thought: It occurred to me that it was the first time that my wife and I had spent more than a day apart since we married in February. I forgot about everything else.

After I got back from my brief trip to Tokyo, we spent a Saturday at park just east of Sendai, right along the ocean where the 3/11 tsunami came in. Parks in Japan tend to be very small and not really parks at all, by western standards. This one is an exception--plenty of space, a huge slide, nice views, and places where you can barbecue. I wish every city in Japan had this kind of park.

You can see in the photos below that they've set up barricades--this is where the tsunami came in. I wonder how effective these are. Hope we never find out.

Off to Hokkaido. The first time I visited Hokkaido was by myself in 2005 at Christmas time aboard the [Cassiopeia train](https://jprail.com/trains/sort-by-type/overnight-trains/overnight-express-train-cassiopeia.html) which went out of service in March 2016. It was the first overnight train I had ever taken, and I distinctly remember two things: a drunk business man taking the bottom bunk in my cabin and second, the helpless feeling that I was truly heading into unknown territory, far from the safe confines of Tokyo. Still, despite my noisy bunkmate, by the time I stepped off the train, I was even more sold on Japan.

We went to Niseko, a popular ski resort, to visit friends. There's a staggering amount of ski chalets and condos for sale around the mountain that are incredibly modern. They sell for over a million USD and mostly to Chinese investors who may never step foot in the country. It seems like the local government may be eyeing who is buying up the real estate after seeing [what happened to Vancouver](https://www.fortunebuilders.com/one-third-of-vancouvers-real-estate-market-is-owned-by-chinese-buyers). We drove around, went on a hike to a lake shaped like a moon at the foot of the mountain, spent some time in the onsen, and just tried to relax.

We went and visited a former colleague of mine and her new baby girl, Riko. Riko was a champ. We had a very tasty lunch at a place that had a very protective dog. Hokkaido was as rustic and wild as I hoped it would be. The food was ok, but the sense of openness you get from being there is rejuvenating.

The following day, we drove south of Niseko towards Toyoura and arrived at a huge lake that I had seen on Google Maps.

The view didn't disappoint.

The island in the middle is called Nakajima Island. There are boat tours on the other side of the lake that take you to the island. Suddenly a very nice elderly woman came up to us and offered to take our photo. She knew the right angles to get the sun just right. As it turns out she was selling helicopter tours.

We decided to take her up on her offer.

We only went up for 12 minutes. It was worth it. The hotel at the top of the mountain is called The Windsor Hotel Toya Resort & Spa. It was cool to see the fog rolling in over the town from Uchiura Bay. Looked like something out of a video game.

After returning to the car, we drove a ways up the road to two more parks along a different part of the lake. Hokkaido is as beautiful as I hoped it would be. Still much too cold to live there, but I'd highly recommend visiting if you have the chance.

The next day, after some coffee at a very strange cafe and a brief trip to a super depressing park with empty trains that would make a great set for a horror movie, we met up with my former colleague one more time to see the baby, meet her husband, and to have a small barbecue in a park on the side of the mountain. The weather held up and we ate good food and listened to great music. Riko was a champ, again.

Finally, it was time to take the train back from Niseko to Sapporo. It was a long train ride back to Sapporo. They're going to build a bullet train there in 2030, but for now you only have the local which crawls along.

We had some time to kill before our flight back to Sendai, so we walked around Sapporo a bit. It's a beautiful city. Lots of flowers and of course it was very clean. Saw some little yellow guy looking over us.

After we flew home, we had udon noodles at our favorite udon place. It felt good to be home. Between the trip to the US, my brief trip to Tokyo, and the trip to Hokkaido, we were exhausted.

A week later, we were well-rested and decided to go to a festival. I had always wanted to go to festivals before I moved here, mainly because of this video:

But corona put the brakes on that. It's nice to see things opening back up again. It feels like the culture is blooming.

The next weekend, we decided to go to a bakery near one of Sendai's best parks. After that, we went and had lunch followed by coffee at this really modern coffee shop that's out in the middle of nowhere. You find a lot of that here--something really surprising way out in the countryside that seems to have no earthly business being there. It's how I imagine the people of the countryside feel when they see me.

In the evening, we went to an anniversary party for our favorite cafe. 1 year in business--I don't know how they managed to do it. This food, I'm telling you, is some of the best food I've ever eaten anywhere. Oyster (I didn't partake), grilled asparagus with smoked mayo, potatoes with smoked mayo, and maybe the best steak I've had in a year. Fried chicken and some gin and tonics. We are very lucky to have found this place.

During the final weekend in May, we went to a new coffeehouse by a very famous pizza place up in the mountains, southwest of the city. I say famous because the pizza place has 1 Michelin star. The pizza place and coffeehouse are located next door to each other but have different owners. The town is a very nice part of this region since it's up in the mountains and it's filled with onsen hotels. We will be visiting again soon.
