To start the month, we took a trip to beautiful Zao, which is just over the mountain from Sendai. I feel more and more like the virus is just something we're going to have to learn to live with. I don't want these precious summer months to go to waste.

The road up was extremely curvy, which challenged our Prius a little, but provided great views. We took the long way so we could see Okama, a pool of water on the summit of an active volcano.

Zao overlooks Yamagata and provides some of the best skiing in the area. We will definitely be back, as Yamagata has some of the best produce I've had in Japan.

We had a so-so lunch, checked into our hotel, and found a little cafe run by a guy who had lived there since 1968. He said he used to commute to the cafe from Sendai each week, but moved here a decade or so ago since he stopped working. He had an excellent record collection. Then we went up the mountain.

Here's a panorama from the top of the mountain.

We then took the chairlift down. I had never taken a chairlift down a mountain, only up. It was a tad nerve-wracking.

It was worth it, since at the bottom there was a small lake which made for another great panorama.

Later, we found a NY-style pizza place in downtown Yamagata after getting denied at two other places. It's amazing how you need a reservation even in smaller towns--there's always enough people to fill the seats. We learned our lesson. The owner of the pizza place was a young guy who owned a beautiful classic Chevrolet (I think it's from 1964).

Yamagata was so nice and low-key, as it was sandwiched between the mountains on each side and was noticeably cooler than Sendai. The view from our room was great.

The next day, we made time to go to one of my wife's family's favorite stores that sell handmade plates and cups. The old woman who runs it has been making these dishes for at least 60 years and has lived her whole life in Yamagata. She offers you pickles when you come in, and has a calendar taped up over her kitchen.

The following weekend, we finally made it to the Sendai zoo. Cute animals, cute kids, but man, the summer heat was getting to everyone.

At the end of the month was my birthday, for which I wasn't expecting much. My wife surprised me with a trip to Kanazawa, on the other side of the country. Neither of us had visited this region of Japan before, so we were excited to go. We had a great time, but the 97 degree heat was unrelenting.

We visited the famous Kanazawa modern art museum. It was...ok. There were a lot of people not enjoying the art and mostly taking selfies. There's a famous pool exhibit where you can walk under a pool that someone built. It's a novel idea, but overall I was a tad disappointed.

We didn't realize this, but Kanazawa was having its annual fireworks festival the day we were there. We didn't go to avoid the crowds (COVID is up here) but we had a romantic dinner and then headed outside to catch the end of the festivities. I took two shots that I really loved (see the end of this post). Afterwards we took a "light-up bus" around the city which allows you to go to various famous sites that are lit up during the nighttime.

Below is a view from the bus.

Kanazawa is famous for its "Kyoto-like" neighborhoods. They were indeed beautiful.

The next day was even hotter. We strolled by the market and found this random carrot in ice. By 10:30 it was 96 degrees, so don't feel too bad for the carrot.

We then visited Kanazawa's famous turntable museum which had an unbelievable number of vintage phonographs and technology, mostly donated by executives from Sony and other wealthy collectors. A gentleman there gave a lovely talk and demonstration, going chronologically decade by decade, allowing guests to hear the progression of sound quality.

After the museum we headed off to lunch. It was getting miserably hot, but the river was beautiful. You could tell there was some money in the area based on the quality of the buildings. That's not always a given with water-adjacent properties in Japan.

My wife made reservations at one of the most famous steakhouses in Kanazawa, which serves Noto beef. I had never had it.

Without question: **It was the best steak I had ever eaten.**

Full from lunch, we took a cab back to one of the "Kyoto-inspired" old neighborhoods and walked around. We had had it. It was simply too hot to be outside. We headed to the station and took the train home. It was easily the best birthday I've had in my 30s.

And there was one more surprise that made this birthday extra special...

Reflecting on the last year of my life, it's been a great year as we transitioned from engagement into marriage. I am very lucky to be where I am and I'm even luckier to have her. She knows me all too well.
