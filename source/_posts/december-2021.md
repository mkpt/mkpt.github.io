Our trip to Seattle for my sister’s wedding was cancelled by the Omicron variant. This, coupled with a family health scare and you can see that December didn’t turn out the way we thought it would. We carried on.

In early December, I purchased a new (used) car, a Subaru, and we took it through the snow and over the mountains to go eat ramen in Yamagata to try to take my mind off things. No troubles at all driving through the hills, though it’s always a joy to drive with your soon-to-be in-laws in the backseat.

To ease the stress of the trip cancellation, we made many trips to the various local coffeehouses we frequent. When I don’t know what to do or where to go, and I’m stuck, I put a cup of coffee in front of me and wait for things to sort themselves out.

The Tohoku region is filled with small, nearly empty towns, and yet all of them seem to have one or two coffee shops that are still hanging on.

We took another trip over the mountains to pick up some Yonezawa beef. Yonezawa beef is something else, if you haven’t had it. We stopped at a cafe on the way back, and then had a wonderful New Years feast with my fiance’s parents. I had never had beef this good.

These two huge cats live at this American-themed restaurant up in the mountains we go to sometimes. They are living the life. The restaurant is run by a little grandpa who is always dressed like an American cowboy (hat, boots, and all) and always makes us feel welcome.

The winter here is cold and gray and it’s taking some getting used to. I was not prepared for how cold it is here, and am not sure we will stay here long term. It's ~30 degrees F every day, none of the houses have central heating or insulation. It’s Japan on hard mode, but I’m fortunate to have a small community of friendly faces around for support.
