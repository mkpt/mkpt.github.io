In 2020, I spent a week by myself in Kyoto traveling around and seeing the sights. I remember it vividly. At the time, I was still processing the end of my previous relationship and was wondering when and where I was going to find the energy to start looking for another relationship. At a friend’s suggestion, by the end of the week, I had gone out on two Bumble dates and suddenly felt like I had all the confidence in the world. About a week later, I met my wife.

Fast forward to this month. We went to Kyoto for a few days for wife’s birthday and to have some much belated wedding photos taken. The tourists have definitely returned to Japan now that corona is fading away. Nowhere is that more evident than Kyoto. We made our way through the crowds, had some good food, and enjoyed a bit of the fall foliage.

Before we went to Kyoto, however, we took a road trip north to a giant public garden.

Then it was off to Kyoto. We took an airplane this time which was much more cost-effective than taking the train. We hit a few of the touristy spots and had a set course meal for her birthday dinner.

Returning to Sendai, we found a cafe overlooking the ocean near a Michelin star soba place. The restaurant was L-shaped so you could look at the window and see other diners across the courtyard. Sendai continues to surprise.

The next week, as if we didn’t have enough going on, we decided to go to Tokyo to visit a few friends and their kids just before Halloween. In the morning, it was two little girls. In the afternoon, it was too little boys. A stark contrast of energy and noise.

It was good to come back home.
