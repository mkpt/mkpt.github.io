With January vanquished (barely), we were itching to go out. Unless you’re well off, staying at home in Tokyo is pretty unpleasant. My theory is that the housing situation in Tokyo—huge prices for small rooms—works because people assume they won’t have to spend a lot of time there. With the virus, every day is a reminder of how small 250 square feet is.

We went to look at apartments in Yokohama today, as Yokohama represented better value for money than central Tokyo. It could get us closer to nature and still allow me to commute to work if my company forced us to return to the office. We found a few nice places, but decided not to pull the trigger.
