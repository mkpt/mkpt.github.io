The winters in the north of Japan are long. They’re not nearly as long as the winters in Hokkaido, the most northern island, but this year it felt like it was going to last forever. This year, the temperature would quietly sneak up a few degrees above freezing and you’d think the worst of it was behind you, but then suddenly you’d find yourself reaching for the electric blanket again.

One of the hardest things about living in Japan is that nearly every house lacks two features that even a lot of older American houses have. Those features are:

1. Central heating
2. Insulation
    

It’s hard to know which I miss more. These features are available in new houses here, but are missing from most older houses. The value of houses in Japan rarely appreciate here (a topic for another day), so many people don’t see them as worthy investments and skimp on good heating and insulation.

Thankfully, April put a nail in winter’s coffin and we were all grateful. We went and saw a friend’s new baby as well as a flower park where everything was in bloom.
