In personal news, we decided to move to a new part of town and from an apartment into a house. Our current place has a beautiful view but is very cold in the winter and lacking a functional dishwasher since our landlord refuses to fix it. The house is a tad old and in a much quieter part of town, but allows for pets, so we didnâ€™t hesitate to go meet some potential pals.

It really was a quiet month. Fall is fast-approaching.
