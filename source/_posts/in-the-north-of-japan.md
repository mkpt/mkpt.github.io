Most of the time, when people are talking about Japan, they’re talking about Tokyo or Osaka, typically. The most common event associated with the Tohoku region, unfortunately, is the 2011 tsunami.

The north of Japan has a lot to offer though—mountains, farmland, a few beautiful lakes, and decent skiing. Honestly at this point, the jury is still out if we want to stay here long term. During Golden Week, we decided to hit the road and see a bit more of the north by car.

First to Akita…

We made time to visit the local tower with a panoramic view. When people think of Japan, they typically think of Shinjuku and the big bright lights of the city. Most of the rest of the country, however, looks like the views below. It’s a lot of rain-drenched seaside towns, old neighborhoods and industrial warehouses.

Then we cruised up north along the coast to Aomori. Aomori is in rough shape. There were a lot of empty buildings and our hotel was pretty unpleasant. I hope they can refresh things in the future to entice people to visit. We left the city a day early to get back home.

While in Aomori, we came across a parade happening in the middle of the day. Aomori is famous for its floats, so we went to the float museum afterwards.

And then on to the museum. Japanese museums can be hit or miss. This one was excellent.

After the museum we headed home. It was a lot of driving during a long holiday weekend—think I’ll take the train next time.
