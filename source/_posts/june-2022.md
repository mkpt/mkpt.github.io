We began June by visiting a friend in Chigasaki, about an hour or so southwest of Tokyo, just a ways down the water from Kamakura. Kamakura is the hot spot right now. It's about as close to California as Japan comes, including the real estate prices. A viral article named Chigasaki the 5th best small city in the world a few years ago, so with our friend offering to put us up for free for a few days, we decided to see what the fuss was about and see if we'd like to live there.

It was gray and rainy the first day...

...but cleared up the 2nd day onward.

Chigasaki was great, but the cost of land is pretty crazy. The houses are all very close together, and I want a drum set at home. We will give it some thought.

After Chigasaki, we spend Saturday night in Yokohama visiting family. As a treat, we stayed in the Landmark Hotel on the 64th floor. Worth going at least once. The circular windows below are from just above the bathtub in our room.

On Sunday, we had breakfast in a quiet Yokohama neighborhood at a place called Buy Me Stand, which is an Okinawa-based American style diner. They have a few locations. I cannot understate how delicious the bacon and eggs are. We walked through the Yokohama neighborhood afterwards before heading down to the US military base at Yokosuka, which I had never been to. A family friend works there so we got in and walked around. It was a bit surreal to eat at a Chili's. I didn't take any photos in the base unfortunately.

For the rest of the month, things were pretty quiet. My wife's mother's birthday is near father's day, so they celebrate the days together. We went on a bit of a road trip north of Sendai to Oshima Island. You can see where the tsunami came in, and where they had to rebuild protections in case of another earthquake. Reminded me of the Oregon coast a bit.

Here are a few other random shots from the month. Can't beat the Sendai sunset.
