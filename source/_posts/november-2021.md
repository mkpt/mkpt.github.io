November was like a repeat of October—went out with friends, and then we find ourselves at Disneyland (our friends invited us for their little girl's birthday). This time we went to Tokyo Disney Sea. It was so-so.

Had an incredible lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Steakhouse in Roppongi. Worth every penny.

Disneyland in Japan feels like it was built by someone who had only ever seen photographs of Disneyland in California. It’s like a fake watch or those Apple stores in China—it looks like the real thing, but the magic is missing.

Back home. Our apartment is freezing, but you can’t beat the view.
