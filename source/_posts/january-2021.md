January in Japan can be a lonely time of year. The loneliest, even. For city dwellers, the majestic skyscrapers that act like lanterns 11 months out of the year start to feel like they’re entombing you in darkness.

I’ve never forgotten what Kurt Vonnegut said about loneliness. Kurt Vonnegut is probably my favorite author, most likely because I read his books more than anyone else’s when I was younger. Rose-colored glasses, and all that.

Vonnegut says:

“_What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.”_

I didn’t really appreciate this sentiment until I moved to Tokyo.

As anyone who has visited Japan will tell you, Japanese cities tend to be pretty gray and cold. There’s a lack of greenery in general, but in the winter it’s especially noticeable. It can start to feel like the deck is stacked against you; like the country was purposely designed to maximize feelings of isolation.

Isolation and loneliness are part and parcel of immigrating to a foreign country where you don’t speak the language, I reckon. Layer on winter over any major Japanese city and then pair that with the unbearable stillness that tends to linger after the New Years holiday here, and January, for all its promise of a fresh start, becomes quite an uphill battle.

To combat this, the Japanese typically do what Americans do: coalesce with strangers in warm, brightly lit commercial spaces, cafes and restaurants and try to wait it out. Unfortunately, New Years is the one time of year when, without fail, people will actually take time off of work.

In fact, the New Years holidays often start in late December ahead of the actual holiday, so it’s not uncommon to find a "closed Dec 23-Jan 5" sign on the door. I have an annual reminder in my phone to buy groceries and get cash out of the ATMs since ATMs go out of service during this time.

Depending on the part of the country you’re in, it may even be too cold to venture outside, so most people just stay at home under a heated blanket and eat satsuma oranges.

I try to use this time to call friends and see how they’re doing. A familiar voice you haven’t heard in a while—the best way to warm up. Without fail, I regret not keeping in touch with people throughout the year. Inevitably, I tell myself I will do better this year.

Still, winter in Tokyo can’t mask the eccentricities of the city, most of all its people. Not sure how I feel about dogs in footwear. Or rabbits on leashes.
