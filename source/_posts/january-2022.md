Another year has gone by. I am engaged, living in a new city with new surroundings, and am trying to acclimate despite the never-ending pandemic.

I went to Roppongi to the US Embassy to get an affidavit that says I can marry my fiancé. I had to make an appointment a month in advance, but it felt good to be on US soil for a few minutes.

We attended a New Years festival where people burn things in a huge, huge bonfire. Miserably cold, but I didn't think it was right to complain in front of the men wearing basically loincloths. We also visited a shrine, which is customary here. New Years was not a big holiday growing up at all, but it's becoming increasingly meaningful for me here. This is a wonderful and unexpected development.

Days later, we went to another shrine for more blessings and prayers.

We also drove over the mountains to Zao, one of the bigger ski resorts in the area. In the 1980s, it was _the_ area to go for skiing. We had lunch and went to a cafe. As we left, I had to help push a car that was stuck in the snow. The man was very grateful. I was a hero.

And hey, one more shrine visit for good luck.

Got back to Sendai quite late in the evening. We went and had udon at a chain that’s now valued at multiple billions of dollars and due to open in the United States. I guess that’s the power of handmade noodles.
