It’s 2023. This marks almost five years in Japan. This year I will be applying for permanent residency, which, if accepted, means Japan will take the lion’s share of my taxes, but which will also mean I can stay here as long as I want.

First up, we went to our local temple to pray for health and good luck in the new year.

The food scene in Sendai is pretty rudimentary, but there are some highlights. For example, there’s a pizza place west of Sendai that has a Michelin star. We try to go there when we get up early enough on weekends. They use real San Marzano tomatoes and the pizza is perfectly charred.

Let’s talk about new year traditions in Japan, because they get pretty wild. At New Years, a majority of Japanese people go out to the grocery store or some drug store and pick up something called a _shimekazari_. It’s basically some straw tied together with some other decorations. Each year, you buy one size bigger than the last year, because you need more luck each year (or so I’m told). Then, in your neighborhood, there’s usually a massive bonfire where you burn this.

So yeah, January is quite eventful.

We headed north to go skiing for the first time in Japan. The last time I went skiing was in Hokkaido in 2005 by myself. I took a bullet train to Sapporo and then an early morning bus. I distinctly remember the following points about that journey:

- There was a driver, me, a female guide, and _no one else_. It was, essentially, a private bus.
- She spoke over a hand radio to the passengers (me, just me) in Japanese every time we passed a notable spot.
- I smiled and acknowledged her commentary. She smiled and seemed appreciative. I think both of us knew that I had no idea what she was saying.
    
This time, we went to Appi Kogen, one of the more popular ski resorts in the northern part of Japan. It was my wife’s first time skiing. She did great, but my goodness, it was cold. A great way to start the year.
