Halloween is approaching, and I was going to let life in a foreign country get in the way of my Halloween traditions. We had friends over and made crepes, and then we carved pumpkins.

It escapes me sometimes how lucky I am to live where I do and to have the family I have. Birthdays and holidays tend to remind me of this fact and bring me back down to earth. For my wifeâ€™s birthday, we took our in-laws and drove down to Nikko, probably the most popular temple outside of Tokyo. We stayed at an airbnb, had a nice dinner, and walked around Lake Chuzenji, one of the most beautiful lakes in Japan.
