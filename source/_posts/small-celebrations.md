June in Japan is lovely. Every year I’m surprised how pleasant everything feels (before summer hits and the heat becomes unbearable). It was kind of a month of small celebrations. We went to a small coffee festival, went to lunch for my mother-in-law’s birthday (teppanyaki), and took a trip to a winery up in the mountains. Japanese wine is _rough_, so says my father-in-law. We also made time for coffee and sweets.
