Something about the spring brought out all of the dogs in Nakameguro. No complaints here. Although I will say, we were a cat household growing up, so I never got used to dogs. I feel like dogs belonged outdoors. It always made more sense to me for them to be outside with all their energy, drool, noise and fur. Still, nothing lifts my spirits like seeing a dog on the streets of Tokyo.

I also went to Yokohama to meet my girlfriend's sister with whom I needed to discuss my intentions; that is, my intentions of marrying her older sister. I met the folks back in March and it went smoothly. A funny thing came up during my discussion with my potential sister-in-law: the name change.

I wanted her sister to take my name. She brought up the fact that, in the past, her mother had made comments about mukoyōshi, or the practice of a man taking the woman’s name if there’s no male heir in the wife’s family. This was common when the family was quite well-to-do or had a company associated with the name. Neither of us were sure how serious her mother was about this.

> _This adult adoption may take place in marriages where the woman's family is of a higher socio-economic rank than the man's family; where the woman has no brothers who can continue the family name; when the man has been disowned by his own family; and/or when the man's natural family has a notorious or shameful background and he prefers to hide his identity._

We had a good, long nervous laugh about the whole situation. I’m sure it’ll be fine.

We took a two-day trip to see Mt. Fuji up close in Kawaguchiko. I’ve seen hundreds of mountains, but seeing Mt. Fuji up close was something special. We rode the tram up to the top to see the mountain and took it back down where we rode the swan boats. We rented an Airbnb house—it was very nice to get out of the city and be reminded that there’s an entirely different lifestyle available in this country.
