One of the best ways to feel the time passing in your life is to meet your friends’ children. We visited Tokyo in April to see the cherry blossoms, and it felt like I was just holding some of these animals the other day. Now they’re walking around and causing all kinds of problems.

The way the cherry blossoms blanket the streets…I will never tire of it. The shots below were taken in Ebisu and Nakameguro, my old stomping grounds. If you’re going to visit Japan, spring is a great time.

A few more randoms from this month…ramen, demons, and an outdoor market.
