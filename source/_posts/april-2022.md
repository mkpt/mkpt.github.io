The last time I saw my mother and father was 870 days ago--November 23, 2019. Then suddenly, the world went mad.

Here is a 100% factual timeline of the events leading up to our April trip to Seattle:

- **July 2021**: We booked a trip to Seattle for December 16, 2021 to see my family and attend my sister’s wedding.
- **Late 2021**: Omicron variant hits.
- **December 14, 2021 ~11pm**: We are at home in Japan, and up late worried about our trip. We decide after much discussion to cancel our trip. I am walking across the living room towards my phone to call my mother. Before I can reach the phone, it starts ringing. I know instantly something bad happened. It’s my mother telling me my father is in the hospital. They had found him on the kitchen floor unable to stand up. When she visited him in the hospital, he had no memory of her.
    
- **December 18**, **2021**: My sister marries her fiance. We attend over zoom. My father is in the hospital and cannot attend the wedding.
    
- **January 2022**: We book a trip for April 2022, COVID be damned.
    
- **February 5, 2022**: My wife and I get married at City Hall here in Japan. She changes her last name.
    
- **Mid-February:** In the afterglow of our marriage being official, we realize the name on her ticket is no longer her legal name. The flight was purchased on Expedia and is JAL operated by United. Over the course of the next five weeks, we call the following six parties _dozens_ of times to try—and unsuccessfully—change the name on her ticket:
    
    - JAL English and Japanese customer support
        
    - United English and Japanese customer support
        
    - Expedia English and Japanese customer support
        
- **March 16, 2022:** [A 7.3 earthquake hits the north of Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIo5Xce3X6w). The train from Sendai to Tokyo is derailed and out of service. We have to prepare an alternate route to Tokyo.
    
- **April 5, 2022**:
    
    - We take a bus from Sendai to Tokyo two days before the flight to stay one night in a hotel and see friends before we leave. We _still_ haven’t resolved the name issue. I am a wreck.
        
    - We arrive in our hotel in Shinjuku and stay one night—the room is oddly shaped and 1000 degrees. The air conditioning is symbolic, it seems.
        
- **April 6, 2022:** The next day, we ask for a room transfer. We are escorted by a staff member down 3 floors, are walked down a hall to a much larger room, agree to move rooms, and take the elevator up 3 floors to retrieve our luggage. When we take the elevator back down, every single door has a plastic bag with food and towels on it — _this is a quarantine floor for passengers arriving from countries where the pandemic is especially terrible._ Legally, the hotels have to provide this service, but they could have told us that. We immediately check out and leave for another hotel. I am beyond myself.
    
- **April 7, 2022:** To fly to the US, we have to have a negative COVID test within the past 24 hours of flying. We have it scheduled for this morning. We take it, pass, and head for the airport way early so that we can sort out the name thing. We arrive at the airport, exhausted, frustrated, tired, and just wanting to see family. We head to the JAL gate — not open. We head to United — can’t help you. We wait for the JAL gate to open — can’t help you. We are down to the last 60 minutes before flying. I am on my phone about to hit “CONFIRM” on a $7,000 last minute flight for my wife to fly from Tokyo to Vancouver to Seattle. My chest hurts. She’s got her arm around me. We wait in line for United, and a woman (bilingual, thank goodness) hears our story and pulls us aside. We are sat there for what feels like 45 minutes as she hammers away on a keyboard that sounds like one of those big IBM ones from the 80s. I have my finger over the “CONFIRM” button. Finally we hear, “Yes!” and she returns to us with two updated tickets with the right name on it. Security > Customs > Gate > Seat…..in maybe 10 minutes. I will never forgot this experience.
    
When we arrived in Seattle, we were on the home stretch. We sprinted for the bus to take us to the rental car area. The final hurdle presented itself: I had booked a car at the wrong location, as I was told at the counter. I thought I was booking it at the Airport Hertz.

_Wrong_.

It was the Hertz just off of Aurora Avenue in Seattle, about 90 minutes away. _Of course_. I closed my eyes, took a breath, called an Uber, and 90 minutes later a young man who I can only assume was nicknamed Bongmaster Pete by his friends was handing me the keys to the car. We sailed north in the car, stopping only for gas and Chick-fil-a.

Once we arrived at home though, all was set right with the world. I swung open the door to the car and my mom was there. Big hug. Seeing my father again, putting my arms around him...I was unprepared for how it felt to have him physically next to me after almost 900 days apart.

Seeing my dad, mom, sister, her new husband who I was meeting for the first time, getting to introduce them to my wife—it was like a sudden leap forward in time for our family. I didn’t know it was possible to miss other humans this much.

We did everything. We baked cookies, drove around the northern part of the state a bit, went shopping, saw many old friends, saw relatives, and ate some delicious home-cooked food.

The best news of all: learning I was going to become an uncle in September. Quite the month, April.

Never in my life did I think I would miss scenes like this, but I do. Sopping wet grass, expansive lands, the gray sky—_home_.

We couldn’t just see Seattle, though, especially after the journey we had. We took a surprise side trip to California for a few days so my wife could see the sight of real, California beaches and so I could recharge a bit. We ate some good food, went surfing, saw some wonderful sights, and made our way back to Seattle before heading back to Japan.
