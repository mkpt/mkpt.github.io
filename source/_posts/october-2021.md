My fianc√© and I met Oct 26, 2020, a week after her birthday. For our first birthday together, I took her to Disneyland. We stayed in the Beauty and the Beast suite, I gave her some earrings, and we had terrible Disneyland food. It was a great day.

As I am living up in Sendai solo at this point, I met up with some of her friends and their little boy. We had lunch together and then went to a little zoo. I had never seen a capybara in person. They're just as great as everyone says they are.
