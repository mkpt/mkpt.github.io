The ring is on its way. Buying an engagement ring was much easier than I thought. However you’d think they’d offer something—a little pomp and circumstance, a pat on the back, a casual “way to go”—but no, they just wanted my credit card.

June is a great month in Japan. It’s not too hot yet, the parks all turn green, and you can spend time in those green parks while it’s not too hot.

Took another day trip to Kamakura to see the ocean. People were out and about. Good to see some life returning to the country.

We took a day trip to Utsunomiya to eat at Min Min, a gyoza shop that I last went to about 10 years ago. The line was long but worth the wait.

We went to Inokashira Park, which is one of the nicest parks in Tokyo. It's right near the Studio Ghibli museum. Lots of trees, people, and assorted wildlife.
