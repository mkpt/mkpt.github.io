Newly engaged. Back to reality, the city, and big changes.

I moved to Japan in 2018 and lived in 3 different locations in Tokyo since then. But for the first time in 10 years, I made the decision to live outside of Tokyo since my company went full remote. We chose to move to my fiance's hometown, Sendai. There's water and mountains and my hope is this will provide a nice balance of city life and natural features. Below are the last shots of the city before we left. I decided to go somewhere in Tokyo I had never been--to the top of Shibuya Sky, an observation deck that was built a few years ago.

We packed up, sent the movers on their way, stayed in a hotel (the breakfast), said goodbye to friends and their cute baby (the feet), and headed north. My fianc√© needed more time to leave her job, so I will be moving a month or so ahead of her.

Excited for the engagement, the move, and all of the adventure this will surely bring.
