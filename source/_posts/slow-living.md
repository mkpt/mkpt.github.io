I think when people think of life in Japan, they think of two things:

- The glittering lights of the central Tokyo metropolis    
- Quiet, rural countryside scenes that make up the typical Studio Ghibli movie
    

The truth is somewhere in between, as my life demonstrates. The space between the urban sprawl and the quiet but decaying countryside is filled with a kind of “medium” life. It’s hard to explain, but I will try: it’s not enough to feel busy—it’s most definitely a slower pace of living. But it’s sometimes so slow that you are left unsatisfied. Sometimes it can be hard to see that time is moving forward.

It’s kind of like the suburbs in the US — if you’re young, you probably hate it here, but once you see a bit of the wider world, you start to appreciate the nothingness of it. It forces you to find the joy in smaller, everyday details.

These two monsters, for example, keep things interesting.

When you live further out, away from new and interesting restaurants, you inevitably have to find joy where you can. If you are the adventuresome type, Sendai will not suffice. But if you temper your expectations, you can find something to enjoy in simpler fare, like this a homemade salisbury steak over Japanese-style Napolitan spaghetti. I can hear my grandpa upset over the concept of ketchup spaghetti with peppers, but trust me, when done right, it’s exquisite.

We managed to go to yakiniku with friends. Yakiniku is one of my favorite things about living in Japan. It allows you to order a little and then add on as you see fit. It’s interactive. It’s social. It’s just awesome. Our friend’s little boy was excited.

Later in the month we made our way to a coffeehouse way out in the middle of nowhere. It was highly rated and quite crowded. All of this is just the nothingness of life in Japan. It’s all just quiet moments in between work and fretting about life decisions. It’s a tranquil way to live.
