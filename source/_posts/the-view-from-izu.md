In August, we finally got around to visiting Izu. Izu is southwest of Tokyo and feels like an island, though it is not. I think it’s because of the mountains and all of the greenery, coupled with the fact that a lot of wealthy Japanese families own land here.

First up, we went a famous waterfall. Not sure what its claim to fame was, exactly.

We went to a cat museum. I wasn’t sure what to expect.

Next we headed Omuroyama, a volcano. We had seen YouTube videos of this before. We took the chair lift up to the top and hiked along the edge, climbing hire ever still. The view over the edge was beautiful. You could see forever. There were statues along the way where people prayed.

Next we headed for the coast. There was a small bridge that took you across to a rocky area where dozens of people had gathered to take photos. Seeing people walking on uneven, rocky ground carrying selfie sticks, just above water that would smash them against the rocks—quite a sight.

The next day, it was rainy and gray, so we headed to a local teddy bear museum which was having a Studio Ghibli exhibit, complete with the a giant cat bus.

After the rain let up, we went to a popular viewpoint that looked out over the sea.

On our return to Sendai, we stopped in Tokyo for a night so we could see my sister-in-law. Had some killer steak. Looking forward to the fall and some cooler temperatures.
