December brought a Christmas party, a trip to Seattle, meeting my baby niece for the first time, but perhaps the biggest one of all…

We added some family members of our own in December. My family has had cats as long as I’ve been alive. We’re excited to add these two rescues to our family. It’s baffling to me that Japanese landlords are strict about having pets, and yet the country is obsessed with dogs and cats. It’s one of the most frustrating parts about Japan: study after study confirms loneliness is at an all-time high, and yet people can’t have a single animal in their home to keep them company.

I lost a good wool sweater. My wife says it must have been misplaced.

We held a small Christmas party for friends. Costco is the real hero.

Finally, the big day was here. We were off to Seattle for Christmas. Thankfully, there was no craziness this time (like we experience in April). First thing on arrival—buying a Christmas tree.

My wife had never been to a Christmas tree farm—didn’t take her long to see why we Americans do this every year.

Finally we got to meet my niece. We got to babysit and play with her while her mom and dad had a date night. Hard to beat the fresh smell of a new baby.

We did all the Christmasy things we hadn’t been able to do in years. Japan is basically an ovenless country. They have small, countertop ovens, yes, but nothing compared to the monsters we install in our kitchens in the US. This was my wife’s first time seeing a double oven. It’s already on her list of must-haves for our future home.

Our parents’ cat was standoffish. He’s an old man now, but still wants to be present. Just don’t try to pick him up.

The snow came and we had a fantastic white Christmas. My parents picked a hell of a driveway design, so we all parked in the street as a precaution.

My uncle always goes all out for Christmas. Love that man.
