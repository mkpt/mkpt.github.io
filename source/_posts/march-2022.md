Lots of cafes this month for some reason. The coffee here in Japan is excellent—the espresso could use some work. I’m enjoying Sendai and my new marriage, but it's still so, so cold.

Our trip to the US was rescheduled for April. Fingers crossed things go smoothly. I’ve got a surprise California side trip that my wife doesn’t know about. Gonna try surfing and take a helicopter tour, amongst other things.
