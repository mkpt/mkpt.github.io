April in Tokyo is amazing. Out come the cherry blossoms that line the popular Nakameguro neighborhood where I live. People dress up, they bring their pets, cameras, and this year, of course, their masks.

Spring in Japan is as it is everywhere else—a time for renewal. The world feels in need of renewal this year. The highlight of spring in Japan for most people is of course “Golden Week,” a full week of holidays from the end of April to the beginning of May. For me though, the highlight is the way cherry blossoms bloom and soften up the cold, gray exteriors.

Cherry blossoms are also great because they bring people together. Tokyo is perpetually crowded, yes, but you never feel like the people are particularly coordinated or even aware that others are there. Everyone is always on their way to a destination or headed home. People go towards the station and away from the stations. That’s about the extent of it.

But cherry blossoms are unique in that they’re a destination where you can see Tokyo’s humanity. You can see people marking the passage of time and marking their memories of being together. For so much of the year, life in Tokyo can feel the opposite.

First, people are generally private and quiet, which can feel slightly inhumane. The most interaction I’ve had with the people in my building was when the fire alarm went off and we all had to evacuate the building. It was the social event of the season.

There’s also a lack of awareness of how time is passing each day. The city, mostly, is not built to showcase the seasons. If you saw a picture of Tokyo, you’d be hard pressed to name the month in which it was taken. Not so in April.

Third, and this is especially true during the pandemic: people aren’t spending time being close to each other.

Finally, your view of the city is always a small square of one block of one neighborhood of one sub-region of the city. You never get the sense that you’re seeing a wide swath of humanity.

Cherry blossoms solve all of these problems.

When the cherry blossoms come out, everyone comes together to take photos together. It’s one of the only times of the year where you feel like you can see a cross-section of the kinds of people who live here. Students, elderly people, young couples, foreigners—it’s a buffet of humanity.

Of course if you really want to see the wide swath of humanity in Tokyo, the place to go is up. We had lunch with friends and their two baby girls near Tokyo tower. Quite the view.

Looking forward to a busy spring. Hope you and your family are well.
